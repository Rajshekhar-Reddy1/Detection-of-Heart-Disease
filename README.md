# Detection-of-Heart-Disease
Coronary Artery Disease:
It refers to the narrowing or blockage of the coronary arteries, usually caused by the build-up of cholesterol and fatty deposits (called plaques) on the inner walls of the arteries.

These plaques can restrict blood flow to the heart muscle by physically clogging the artery or by causing abnormal artery tone and function.

This can cause chest pain called Angina. When one or more of the coronary arteries are completely blocked, a heart attack may occur.



Statistics Report:
According to American Heart Association (AHA) heart disease is the leading cause of death among males and females in the United States.

They have estimated that someone in the US has a heart attack about every 40 seconds and it has affected 16.5 million Americans.

In addition with that, patients with no risk factors for heart disease, the lifetime risk of having cardiovascular disease is 3.6% in males while 2.6% in females.

Having 2 or more risk factors increases the lifetime risk of cardiovascular disease to 37.5% in males and 18.3% in females.


There are various factors that affects coronary heart disease. These are as follows:

Risk factors like gender, family history, race, ethnicity etc. are non-modifiable (unable to cure).

Risk factors like cigarette smoking, high blood cholesterol levels, high blood pressure, physical inactivity, etc. are modifiable.


2. Problem Statement
Most of the time it is impossible to identify whether a person has heart disease or not because diagnosis of a heart disease is performed on a combination of clinical symptoms and tests results which is calculated through traditional processes.

Due to the availability of huge number of risk factors it is impossible to achieve accurate results all the time.



Scenario:
Heart Trek, an american hospital is specialized in identification and treatment of heart related diseases.

They do variety of tests to identify the level of risk a patient might be in.

After detecting the level of risk, they perform treatment which could get late if a patient is at high risk.

These tests consumes a lot of time, and meanwhile if a patient is in high risk, it could lead to the death of the patient.

Over the past years they have accumulated data regarding history of patients in addition to detailed information.

They require an automated solution which could prevent these time consuming tests.

So they hired a team of data scientists to find pattern out of the data which could prevent high latency of events.

The target feature in this dataset is named as target which we need to predict.

Target Feature	Potential Values
target	0: No potential heart disease
1: Potential heart disease
